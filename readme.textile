h2. Dependencies

This contains custom elements built using polymer, and a github submodule of some "shared team SCSS styles":https://github.com/ucla/ucla-iam-core.

In order to build dependencies you'll need to install "Node + NPM":https://www.npmjs.com, "Bower":http://bower.io & "Bundler":http://bundler.io if you haven't already. The instructions assume you're running OS X or some flavour of Linux.

# Go to https://nodejs.org and download and run the Node installer for the operating system you're using (or use a package manager of your choice)
# Run @sudo npm install npm -g@ to make sure you're using the latest npm
# Install Bower with npm by running @npm install -g bower@
# Install Bundler (you may need to sudo) with @gem install bundler@
# Navigate to the directory you've cloned/downloaded this repository to
# Run @npm install@
# Run @bower install@
# Run @bundle install@

$ @grunt serve --force@ to view if it gives you some sass
